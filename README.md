# Tractian Challenge

The stack selected to make the challenge was:

* React for the frontend library
* ReactQuery (or Transtack Query) for the data fetching library and cache
* Styled components for better CSS handling
* Vite for bundling and development server
* Axios for HTTP requests
* Zustand for global state management

You can view the required features in the [challenge description](./CHALLENGE.Md).

# Notes

* The search system wasn't so obvious in the challenge, so I just kept the text search to the Assets and Components.
* The CORS of the backend wasn't correctly configured, so I used a proxy to access it ignoring the CORS limitations.
